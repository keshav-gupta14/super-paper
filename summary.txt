## Development Process
The website was developed following a mobile-first approach, ensuring it works well on all devices. The design prioritizes easy navigation and clear presentation of products and contact information, which are the primary needs of the business's customers.

I interviewed the business owner to understand their specific needs and preferences, and incorporated their feedback throughout the development process. The final design balances modern web aesthetics with the traditional values of this established business. The addition of dark mode improves accessibility and provides a better experience for users browsing at night.
